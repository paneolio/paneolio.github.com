Welcome to the Pane & Olio github account.

Well, there's not a lot to show, but feel free to look around and gives us feedback!

We use github to keep our website alive with no costs of hosting, plus we want to share our way of building our web identity with no big hassles and costs.

We're a very small italian restaurant in Amsterdam - as many others - and we currently just want to have a digital business card to sell ourselves and our humble project.

Stay Tuned!
